# FetchTakeHome Challenge
I worked on the exercise using SQL server. Unzipped the files and loaded the JSON data to SQL server tables and created a relational model. I am also including the SQL scripts I used to extract the JSON data to tables. I finished the exercise as best as I can and will include all the queries.
