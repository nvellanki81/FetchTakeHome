Hi,
I am working on the Receipts, Users and Brand data that was provided to me for loading into our data warehouse. 
I have a few questions about the data.

In the Users table I see that for some of the UserID the Last Login is NULL. If they haven't logged in since the user was 
created we might have to move them to an archive table to save on space and cost.

I see a lot of NULL values in the Receipts and Brands data that was provided. I was wondering if we can put in place 
some data governance practices so we can have good data which can make your job easier when making decisions.

When I was querying the data I found that lot of barcodes were missing and also the Brand Code and Category codes are entered 
as text (ex: KRAFT, HUGGIES, BABY etc). I would recommend these values to be integers because even a small mistake when entering 
the text values might give entirely different numbers when you join on these codes.

Since this is JSON data, it takes a few extra steps to flatten the data to different rows and load it to a relational DW. If we 
can move this to a non-relational databases that can handle semi-structured data like JSON it would speed up the process as the 
data grows. Other options would be moving to clould based technologies.

If you have any questions regarding my findings please let me know and I will be happy to answer.

Thanks
Naveen
